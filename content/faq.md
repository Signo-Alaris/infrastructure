  - title: What is a platform?

  - title: What previous projects have you worked on?
    answer: We have worked with many companies building and refining platforms in medicine, finance and media.

  - title: What size projects can you accomodate?
    answer: We can work on projects of any size, from small projects to large enterprise projects.

  - title: What timezone are you in?
    answer: Our people work completely remotely but most are based in the UK, so we are GMT.

  - title: Do you offer after-contract support?
    answer: Of course, any minor changes to the work can be handled for free. If the work is more involved, such as the development of new features, or if you need us to maintain your platform we can do that for you under a separate maintenance contract, but if you want to do it yourself we always provide you with the tools and documentation to do so.

  - title: Do you host the cloud resources?
    answer: We can work with your existing cloud provider or help you set up with a recommended cloud provider based on your use case. We do not offer hosting services at this time, however we can help you set up your own hosting environment.
